                            <h4 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-card__title-text">Cartons</h4>
                            <p>
                              You will need many cartons (boxes) in assorted sizes. They should be clean, in good condition and must have covers so they can be closed and sealed. Start collecting them early. <br><br>

                              Another point to remember: Cartons can be handled easier if they do not exceed 50 lbs., fully packed.

                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-card__title-text">Wrapping Paper</h4>
                            <p>
                              You will need plenty of wrapping paper. Many people save and use their old newspapers but keep in mind that the ink never thoroughly dries and items wrapped in newspapers will most likely be soiled and will require cleaning after unpacking. Movers use unprinted newsprint so for items you prefer to keep clean, it would be best to purchase packing paper.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                              Heavy duty plastic tape, 2 inches wide is most suitable for packing.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                              Felt pens are ideal for marking boxes with information such as "Contents", "Fragile", "This side up", and which room it should be delivered to.

                        <h4 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-card__title-text">Some Things to Consider</h4>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <ol>
                              <li>
                                Start collecting boxes early. An easy way to store cartons so they won't take up storage space is to open both ends of the carton and flatten them out. They can be resealed with tape as you use them.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Pack on a room-by-room basis. Don't pack living room articles with articles from the kitchen. This will eliminate confusion when it's time to unpack.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                If possible, start packing early. Even if you only pack two boxes a day, in thirty days you will have packed sixty boxes. Start in areas where the goods are not in frequent use such as a cellar, attic, garage, closet shelves, etc.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Hanging clothes such as suits, dresses, and coats can best be moved in movers' wardrobe cartons. This will save you the trouble and expense of having your garments cleaned and pressed later. You should not leave clothing in garment bags because they are not designed to withstand moving stress. Clothing travels better in wardrobes with the garment bags folded and placed in the bottom of the wardrobe carton. Elite Movers Denver can supply these for you on moving day at no cost.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Dresser drawers do not need to be empty. Elite Movers Denver can handle chests with the drawer contents intact. But do look through all drawers and remove any breakable articles. Make sure that the drawer contents are not too heavy because too much weight can cause damage to the drawer while en route.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                What size boxes should you use? The rule-of-thumb is that small, heavy articles such as books, records, canned goods, etc. should go in smaller boxes. Bulkier but not-so heavy articles such as pots, pans. linens, small kitchen appliances, etc. would go in somewhat larger boxes. Very bulky. light- weight articles such as blankets, pillows. toys, large lamp shades, shoes, etc. would go in the largest boxes.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Exercise care to avoid over packing a carton. Weight of small cartons should not exceed approximately 40 lbs., medium cartons 50 lbs., and large cartons 60 lbs.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                Do not pack any flammables, combustibles, or explosives. The safety of the shipment is of primary concern. Movers are not allowed to transport paint thinner, gasoline, or anything else of a flammable or explosive nature.
                              </li>
                            </ol>

                              Your kitchen table will serve as an excellent spot for packing all your kitchen items, but to prevent scratching the table, you should cover the surface with a blanket or thick pad.

                              Place a sizable stack of packing paper on the table.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Select a medium-sized carton and line the bottom with several layers of paper for cushioning.

                            <li>
                              Place one plate in the center of the paper.

                            <li>
                              Using at least two sheets, grasp one corner and pull the paper completely over the plate.

                            <li>
                              Stack second plate on first and stretch the second corner over this plate.

                            <li>
                              Place third plate on the stack and fold the remaining two corners over (one at a time) and fold each over the stack of plates.

                            <li>

                            <li>
                              Re-wrap entire bundle with same procedure described previously, then seal the bundle with masking tape.

                              Place the bundle in cartons so the plates are standing on edge. Never lay flatware down. Dishes can tolerate greater stress standing on edge.

                            <li>

                            Less expensive glasses and cups can be "nested" (one placed inside another) and three or four wrapped in a bundle. Tear or cut up some small sheets of paper. Use at least a couple of small sheets between each glass/cup as a protective lining.

                              It's best to pack items such as blenders, toasters, can openers, coffee makers, etc., together in one or two boxes (more as necessary) rather than in other boxes with other goods. When unpacking, they will all be together in the same place. Wrap each appliance individually with two or three sheets of packing paper.<br><br>

                              When all appliances have been packed, if there are any small spaces, wad-up packing paper and fill them in. However, if you have a great amount of space over, you can fill the carton with items such as pots and pans.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              Approximately three pots or pans can be "nested" one inside the other. Tear or cut pieces of packing paper large enough to line two or three sheets in the entire interior of the largest pan.<br><br>

                              Repeat the process and place pans upside down in the middle of your paper stack. Use at least three sheets of paper to wrap the pans.<br><br>

                              Start by grasping one corner of approximately 3 sheets of paper, pulling over and covering the pans. Pull the next 3 corners over one at a time, then seal the bundle with masking tape. Pack in a medium-sized carton.<br><br>

                              Use same procedure for large bowls.

                              Elite Movers Denver does not require your lamps to be packed. We will wrap them in our moving pads. We do require that all lamp shades, globes, and bulbs be removed and packed separately.<br><br>

                              Where possible, lamp shades should be "nested" so that two or three can be packed in the carton. Use CLEAN packing paper (NEVER NEWSPAPERS) as protective linings between each shade. Use the wire rim of the shade to gently lower it into the box to avoid soiling shade.<br><br>

                              To more fully utilize some of the lost space in a lamp carton, place something soft such as hats, small pillows, small blankets or bath towels inside the shades. Do NOT pack wadded-up paper around the shades because this could crush them and cause damage.<br><br>

                              Be sure and mark all sides of the carton in large bold letters: "FRAGILE" - "LAMP SHADES."
