                  Due to the complexity of today’s technology, our movers cannot be trained in all the different systems that are available today. Because of this, we ask that all electronics are disconnected before we arrive.<br><br>

                  <strong>Will you dispose of items?</strong><br>
                  Yes. We have many options to recycle and donate old furniture and moving refuse.<br><br>
